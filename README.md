# Chat
This WebSocket Chat project is a simple web-based chat application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes WebSocket technology to establish a real-time, bidirectional communication channel between the client and the server. Users can enter their username, send and receive messages, and view a log of console messages.

Key Features:

    Real-time chat functionality powered by WebSockets
    Ability to set and display the user's username
    Automatic message upon joining the chat room
    Clickable links in messages with support for images
    Notification support to receive alerts for new messages (if enabled by the user)
    Sanitization of user input to prevent cross-site scripting attacks

To use the chat application, simply enter your username, type your message in the input box, and press enter or click the send button to send a message. You can also click the username button to set a new username, the disconnect button to disconnect from the chat room, and the notification button to enable or disable message notifications.
